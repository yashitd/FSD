    <h2 class="head">INTRODUCTION TO WILDLIFE</h2>
    <!-- <h4 id="para">Wildlife</h4> -->
    <p class="first">Wildlife refers to undomesticated animal species, but has come to include all organisms that grow or live
        wild in an area without being introduced by humans. Wildlife was also synonymous to game: those birds and
        mammals that were hunted for sport. Wildlife can be found in all ecosystems. Deserts, plains, grasslands,
        woodlands, forests, and other areas including the most developed urban areas, all have distinct forms of
        wildlife. While the term in popular culture usually refers to animals that are untouched by human factors, most
        scientists agree that much wildlife is affected by human activities.[2] Some wildlife threaten human safety,
        health, property and quality of life. However, many wild animals, even the dangerous ones, have value to human
        beings. This value might be economic, educational, or emotional in nature.</p>

                <p class="para" style="color: aliceblue;">Humans have historically tended to separate civilization from
                    wildlife in a number of ways, including the legal, social and moral senses. Some animals, however,
                    have adapted to suburban environments. This includes such animals as feral cats, dogs, mice, and
                    rats. Some religions declare certain animals to be sacred, and in modern times, concern for the
                    natural environment has provoked activists to protest against the exploitation of wildlife for human
                    benefit or entertainment.</p>

                    68% since 1970 as a result of human activity, particularly overconsumption, population growth, and
                    intensive farming, according to a 2020 World Wildlife Fund's Living Planet Report and the Zoological
                    Society of London's Living Planet Index measure, which is further evidence that humans have
                    unleashed a sixth mass extinction event.[3][4] According to CITES, it has been estimated that
                    annually the international wildlife trade amounts to billions of dollars and it affects hundreds of
                    millions of animal and plant specimen.[5]</p>

It can involve the trade of living or dead individuals, tissues such as skins, bones or meat, or other products. Legal wildlife trade is regulated by the United Nations' Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which currently has 184 member countries called Parties.[6] Illegal wildlife trade is widespread and constitutes one of the major illegal economic activities, comparable to the traffic of drugs and weapons.[7]</p>

                Wildlife trade is a serious conservation problem, has a negative effect on the viability of many wildlife populations and is one of the major threats to the survival of vertebrate species.[8] The illegal wildlife trade has been linked to the emergence and spread of new infectious diseases in humans, including emergent viruses.[9][10] Global initiative like the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 15 have a target to end the illegal supply of wildlife.[11]</p>

                <p class="para"> Stone Age people and hunter-gatherers relied on wildlife, both plants and animals, for their food. In fact, some species may have been hunted to extinction by early human hunters. Today, hunting, fishing, and gathering wildlife is still a significant food source in some parts of the world. In other areas, hunting and non-commercial fishing are mainly seen as a sport or recreation. Meat sourced from wildlife that is not traditionally regarded as game is known as bushmeat. The increasing demand for wildlife as a source of traditional food in East Asia is decimating populations of sharks, primates, pangolins and other animals, which they believe have aphrodisiac properties.

                    <div>Malaysia is home to a vast array of amazing wildlife. However, illegal hunting and trade poses a threat to Malaysia's natural diversity.
